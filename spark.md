# Spark

Apache Sparkâ„¢ is a multi-language engine for executing data engineering, data science, and machine learning on single-node machines or clusters.

**Structured Data**: This includes data with a well-defined schema, like tables in a relational database. Spark supports common data formats like CSV, JSON, Parquet, ORC, and Avro. It can also interact with data warehouses through JDBC/ODBC connections.

**Unstructured Data**: Spark can handle text files, log files, sensor data, and even images and audio (though these would require specialized libraries).


### Spark vs Hadoop (Map Reduce) (from Reddit)

Spark vs Hadoop, is indeed unfair comparison. Historically Hadoop consisted of two layers: storage (mostly HDFS) and processing (for simplicity MapReduce). That said it would make sense to compare Spark with MapReduce, as those two are processing frameworks capable of processing data stored on some kind of storage (most likely but not limited to HDFS).

The main difference between MR and Spark is that latter is memory centric (remember that disk splits is a thing) through it resilient distributed dataset (RDD) data structure, and by that is more suitable for multistage and/or iterative workloads. One could (and people did) write a book at differences between MR and Spark, but in a nut shell - MR has to write output of each job to storage (HDFS), and in next stage read it in again and so on, this part (serialisation/write/read/deserialisation) is very expensive. While Spark will try to keep data in memory and reuse/recompute if necessary thus making the data available for processing much much faster.



### Apache Spark vs Hadoop (Map Reduce) (from Gemini AI)

**Spark**

Pros:

Speed: Spark is significantly faster than MapReduce due to in-memory processing. It can store intermediate data in memory, reducing disk I/O operations.
Versatility: Spark is not limited to batch processing like MapReduce. It can handle real-time data processing with Spark Streaming and supports various functionalities like machine learning through MLlib.
Ease of Use: Spark offers APIs in Python, Scala, and Java, making development easier compared to the Java-centric approach of MapReduce. Spark also provides an interactive shell for development and exploration.

Cons:

Resource Intensive: Due to its in-memory processing, Spark requires more RAM and computational resources compared to MapReduce.
Security: While improving, Spark's security features are still considered less robust than MapReduce's established security protocols.

**MapReduce**

Pros:

Scalability: MapReduce excels at handling extremely large datasets that may not fit in memory entirely. It efficiently distributes tasks across clusters of machines.
Maturity: MapReduce is a more mature technology with a longer track record and established security features.
Cost-effective: Since it relies less on memory, MapReduce can be more cost-effective for processing massive datasets on commodity hardware.

Cons:

Speed: MapReduce's reliance on disk storage makes it slower than Spark, especially for iterative tasks involving multiple passes over the data.
Limited Functionality: MapReduce is primarily focused on batch processing large datasets. It's less versatile for other big data tasks like real-time analytics or machine learning.
Development Complexity: Programming MapReduce jobs involves writing Java code for the Map and Reduce phases, which can be more complex than using Spark's APIs.
Choosing Between Spark and MapReduce:

For speed, in-memory processing, and versatility across various data processing needs, Spark is the preferred choice.
For processing massive datasets that may not fit in memory entirely, where cost-effectiveness and established security are priorities, MapReduce remains a good option.
In many cases, Spark can be integrated with Hadoop, the ecosystem where MapReduce originated, allowing you to leverage Spark's strengths while still utilizing Hadoop's distributed storage capabilities
